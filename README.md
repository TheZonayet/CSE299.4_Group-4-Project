# CSE299.4_Group-4-Project

**Project Name:Asure**

**Simulated Blockchain-based Verification System**



**Description:**


It will solve a real-world problem: Certificates Verification, Medicine Authenticity Verification, Product Authenticity Verification . We will build a system where:
Universities, institutes, companies issue certificates or Authenticity check reports on the blockchain.Products, medicines or certificates will link through a QR code.Employers and users  can instantly verify authenticity online.
Asure developed using Solidity, JavaScript(React.js), Node.js + Express, MongoDB (NoSQL), HTML, CSS & Bootstrap. We will offer users a platform for verifying authenticity. With an user interface, users will experience smooth navigation and enhanced usability. The application will include BlockChain operations for secure user information storage and settings. Additionally, file operations will handle tasks like verification updates. 
 
**Planned App Features:**



**User Registration:**


Allow users to create accounts by providing institutional information or personal details.



**Blockchain-Backed QR Codes:**

 
 Every certificate, product, or medicine gets a unique QR code linked directly to its blockchain record — impossible to fake or duplicate.



**Dynamic Authenticity Updates:**

 
 If an issuer revokes or reissues a document, the change automatically reflects in real-time on the blockchain.


 
**Multi-Signature Verification:**

 
 High-value certificates or reports require multiple institutional approvals before becoming valid, ensuring extra trust.



**NFT Certificates:**

 
 Each verified certificate can be minted as an NFT, proving digital ownership and transfer history on-chain.
Tamper Detection Alerts
 Instantly alerts users if a certificate, product, or QR code hash doesn’t match the original blockchain record.


**Reputation Scoring for Issuers:**

 
 Institutions and companies earn a blockchain-based “Trust Score” based on their verification history and reliability.


**Crowd-Verified Reporting System:**

 
 Users can report suspicious or fake certificates/products, helping others avoid fraud and improving system transparency.


**Geo-Verification Map:**

 
 Tracks where verification scans happen, helping detect counterfeit hotspots (useful for medicine & product tracking).


**AI-Powered Fake Detection:**


 Before blockchain verification, AI scans uploaded documents or product images for tampering or forgery signs
